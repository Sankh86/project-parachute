            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">As mental health professionals, we understand that COVID-19 has placed an enormous strain on healthcare workers and their families. Project Parachute represents a community of therapists saying, “thank you” to our healthcare workers on the frontline. We are grateful for your work, and we are here to support you.</p>
			<p>Therapy is powerful. It provides individuals with tools and skills to manage life’s stressors and can reduce the impact of stress on health, family, and friendships. Frontline healthcare workers experience many barriers to seeking mental health services. Project Parachute helps reduce some of these barriers by making therapy more convenient and more accessible.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Project Parachute connects therapists who can provide free, flexible, and confidential tele-mental health services with COVID-19 frontline healthcare workers and their families.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">We can’t prevent you from hitting the ground, but like a parachute we can soften your landing.</p>
