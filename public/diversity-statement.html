            	<p style="margin-top: 50px;">Project Parachute views the creation and maintenance of a diverse and inclusive community as essential to our ongoing mission. </p>
            	<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Diversity</span> presents itself in many ways including, but not limited to: disability status, gender identity and expression, nationality or place of origin, political affiliation, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and unique work or life experience.</p>
            	<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inclusion</span> reflects an organizational climate that consciously values the heterogeneity of experiences, perspectives, and identities of a diverse community.</p>
            	<p style="text-align: left;">Project Parachute values all forms of diversity, and strives to disrupt <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/cultural-competency/education/mental-health-facts" target="_blank">existing health inequities</a> by targeting many of the social, cultural, and institutional barriers that exist to prevent people from acquiring quality mental health services. The Project Parachute community actively pursues these ideals, with particular emphasis as follows:</p>
            	<ul class="bulletList" style="padding-left: 40px;">
                	<li>To encourage and support a diverse representation of frontline healthcare workers and their family members in seeking out mental health.</li>
                	<li>To recruit a diverse network of therapists who can provide culturally-competent care to the frontline healthcare workers and their family members who ask for help through our platform.</li>
                	<li>To adapt evidence-based initiatives that support the experience of frontline healthcare workers and their family members from diverse backgrounds when accessing our services and receiving care. </li>
                	<li>To advance diversity and inclusion through community building, education, and open dialogue amongst members of the Project Parachute community. </li>
