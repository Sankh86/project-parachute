            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">This page states our website’s Terms of Use. The Project Parachute website (“Site”) matches frontline healthcare workers and their family members (currently limited to spouses, domestic partners, and children) with free mental health services. These Terms of Use form a binding agreement between you and Project Parachute (referenced throughout using pronouns “we,” “us,” and “our”). Prior to accessing our services, you will be required to accept these Terms of Use.</p>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Acceptable Use: </span>This Site is intended to provide users with general information. We do not recommend or endorse any specific professionals, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on this Site. Reliance on information provided by Project Parachute is solely at your own risk. Your use of the Site is a privilege.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rules of Conduct: </span>We are the sole interpreter of the Site rules of conduct described in these Terms of Use.  Users who violate these terms may have their access and use of the Site suspended or terminated at our direction. At any time, we may take any action with regard to user material if we deem (in our sole discretion) such to be necessary or appropriate.</li>

No waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision.
