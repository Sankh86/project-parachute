					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">How do I know whether I qualify?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Project Parachute serves frontline healthcare workers and their family members (currently limited to immediate family members including spouses, domestic partners, and children). We consider healthcare frontliners to be those who are working in a face-to-face healthcare setting where they may or may not have direct contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19. This includes:</p>
							<ul class="bulletList" style="padding-left: 40px;">
								<li>Health service providers (e.g., Doctors, nurses, emergency medical personnel, hospital laboratory technicians, midwives, physical therapists, at-home-health providers)</li>
								<li>Health management (e.g., Administrative professionals/associates, reception)</li>
								<li>Support workers (e.g., Ambulance drivers, hospital volunteers)</li>
								<li>Craft/trade workers  (e.g., Cleaners, painters and cafeteria workers in a hospital)</li>
								<li>Community health workers who are actively screening, testing, or caring for COVID-19 patients in a professional capacity</li>
							</ul>

					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Do I need a mental health diagnosis to pursue therapy? If I choose to work with a therapist, will I be given a mental health diagnosis?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">You do not need a mental health diagnosis to pursue therapy. People may work with a therapist for many reasons, including for stress management or for advice on how to negotiate relationships during difficult times. It does not mean that you will be stamped with a mental health diagnosis, or that you will have to report a mental health diagnosis to your employer. However, if you would like to use your insurance at any time to pay for therapy, your therapist will have to submit a diagnosis in order for you to receive coverage. If you choose to pay out of pocket, and not file for insurance, your therapist does not have to provide a diagnosis.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">What if I am looking for someone who can prescribe medication?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Not all mental health providers are able to prescribe. Specifically, only Psychiatrists and Psychiatric or Mental Health Nurse Practitioners are eligible to prescribe medications. In most cases these individuals should have an “MD” or “PMHNP-BC” next to their name in our directory. Please note however, that some states prohibit prescriptions based upon interactions that occur online. Even if your state allows practitioners to prescribe online, your provider may still not feel comfortable writing prescriptions following virtual sessions.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Can I request both a group and an individual therapist?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Yes! You may select both services, and there is no limit on how many groups you can join.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">How is the information I provide protected?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">All Project Parachute staff have received training in the proper handling of private data. Your information will be stored on a HIPPA compliant web-platform. Once we’ve matched you with a therapist in your state, we will provide your information to that therapist in an email. Information regarding your participation in Project Parachute will not be made public or sold.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">What happens after I submit my form?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">A Project Parachute volunteer will review your form and send a booking request to the therapist you’ve selected. We will send you a confirmation email at that time. Your new therapist will contact you directly via email or phone within three business days to schedule an appointment.</p>

						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">How many free sessions will I get?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">

						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">

							<p class="faqAnswer">Therapists have to be licensed in the state where you live in order to provide telehealth services to you.</p>

You will be able to see a therapist in this state for the duration of your stay but may need to transition to a different therapist once you’ve returned home.

						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Do I need to pick a therapist that takes my insurance?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">All the therapists on our site have agreed to provide therapy pro bono (so you do not need to worry about insurance). However, the number of free sessions each therapist is willing to provide may differ. If you are interested in seeing a therapist longer term – you may want to select a therapist that takes your insurance.</p>

					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Am I being hired by Project Parachute?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Project Parachute is not a company. We are not recruiting you as an employee. Rather, we are a platform where you may advertise your willingness to provide pro-bono services to frontliners affected by COVID-19 in your state. When individuals match with you for care through the Project Parachute website, you will be asked to contact them directly, to set up care within the scope of your own practice, and to provide your own consent forms and malpractice insurance.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">How do I know whether I qualify to provide support through Project Parachute?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Therapists in our network must be fully or provisionally licensed. Individuals with provisional licenses should discuss pro-bono therapy with their supervisors and check in with their liability insurance before signing up to help.  If you are licensed but don’t currently have a practice, you are still eligible to help. However, Project Parachute is NOT able to provide liability insurance, consent forms, or any other legal documentation. Before you sign up to help, make sure you have access to these documents. You can find more information about this <a href = "https://abundancepracticebuilding.com/">here</a>.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Will my liability insurance cover pro-bono work?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Please contact your insurance company to verify whether pro-bono work is covered under your plan before signing up to help.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">What are the terms of my commitment to Project Parachute?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Currently, we are asking therapists to commit services through the end of December. Participating therapists are able to specify the number of clients they are willing to see and the number of sessions they are willing to provide within this timeframe. Additionally, therapists are expected to work with clients to determine the best timing and length of therapeutic sessions.
								<br><br>Importantly, therapists are able to update their availability on the Project Parachute website at any time and for any reason (e.g., if they’ve obtained a full caseload, or if they themselves are feeling overburdened). It is critical that therapists keep their profiles up-to-date in order to ensure timely care for our  frontliners and their families.
							</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Am I required to provide teletherapy?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">It is mission-critical that all therapeutic sessions are conducted via telecommunication (either synchronous or asynchronous). This might mean meeting over an existing video platform, via Eleos’ integration with Zoom, or via any other secure telecommunication technology (including telephone and email). Therapists should choose which system works best for them and for their clients.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">What rules and regulations exist for the provision of teletherapy?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Each state and profession has its own rules and regulations. We recommend that each provider familiarize themself with the telehealth guidelines of their local licensing board/professional organization. See <a href = "https://www.apaservices.org/practice/clinic/covid-19-telehealth-state-summary?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=apa-pandemics&utm_content=covid-telehealth-state-summary" target="_blank">here</a> for telehealth guidelines by state.</p>

					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">What type of therapy should I be providing?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">We trust your clinical judgment and expertise with regard to evidence-based practice.

					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">I filled out the therapist sign up form. What’s next?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">Your form will be reviewed by one of our matchmaker volunteers. Within 2 business days, your profile will appear on our website under the state, or states, in which you are licensed. Healthcare frontliners and their immediate family members will be able to browse therapists in their state, and to select therapists whom they would like to work with. When we receive a booking request, we will notify you by email. At that time, you will be expected to contact the client and set up an appointment. For administrative purposes, you should treat the client as a patient in your existing practice. The frequency, timing, and length of pro-bono services is up to you. Please be sure to communicate these details to your client at the beginning of therapy.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">How do I update my profile?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">When you sign-up for a profile on Project-Parachute.org, you will be asked to provide a contact email and to create an account password. You will then be able to use this email and password to login to your account and update your profile. To login to your account, click “therapist login” under “get Involved.” Once you are logged in, you will be able to update your availability, photo, bio, etc. If you did not set a password when you signed-up, click “Forgot your password” and you will be emailed a password reset link.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">How do I know whether my client qualifies for pro-bono therapy?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">We attempt to make sure that every client qualifies for our services before matching them with you (you can read our eligibility criterion under the Frontliner FAQs). However, we are unable to verify all inquiries. If you are concerned that your client may not qualify – please reach out to us at <a href = "mailto: projectparachute.eleos@gmail.com">projectparachute.eleos@gmail.com</a>. Keep in mind that sometimes the stress of COVID-19 may not be discussed immediately or directly during therapeutic sessions– and may manifest in relational distress, physiological dysregulation (e.g., dysregulated eating or persistent pain), or the resurgence of pre-existing mental health issues.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">Can I provide therapy to a frontline health worker outside my state?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">No, you cannot practice across state lines. Your client must be physically present in the state where you are licensed during every therapeutic session. We know that a number of states are waiving these rules. However, because Project Parachute is operating nationally, we have decided to limit matches to within each state to avoid overwhelming our volunteer staff.</p>
						</section>
					</section>
					<section class="faqQuestionBox">
						<h2 class="faqQuestion">What happens if I can’t find a time to talk with my assigned patient?</h2>
						<section class="faqAnswerBox" style="display: none;">
							<p class="faqAnswer">We can always rematch clients with someone else. Please ask the patient to submit a request for a different therapist online or to email us at <a href = "mailto: projectparachute.eleos@gmail.com">projectparachute.eleos@gmail.com</a>.</p>
