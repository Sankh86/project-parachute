				<h3 class="faqQuestion">How long will I do therapy with this client?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">That’s entirely up to you. You may want to set this up as time-limited support or you may want to have something more open-ended. Just make sure that you are establishing those expectations for yourself and for your patient ahead of time.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">Teletherapy?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">It’s mission-critical that all visits are done via telehealth. That could mean meeting over your existing platform, via Eleos' Zoom integration or any other secured platform (or it could mean just a plain old telephone call), whatever works best for you.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">What is the timing/length of the sessions?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">It may be time to get creative on the timing and length of sessions. Our standard 53-minute peacetime session might not be a good match for your pro-bono patient’s needs right now.  That’s completely ok.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">What happens if I can’t find a great time to talk with my assigned patient?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">We can always rematch you with someone new! just contact us and we'll help you with this.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">What therapy should I be doing?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">We trust your clinical judgment and expertise with regard to evidence-based practice. We compiled a list of resources for <a href="https://www.notion.so/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Coping-with-Anxiety-and-Loneliness-during-COVID-19-c56e5c676d1243a68cea4ad975e19cdb" target="_blank">Psychological First Aid</a> here.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">Can I provide therapy to a front line health worker outside my state?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">No, you cannot practice across state lines. Your client needs to be physically present in the state where you are licensed during every meeting.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">What are the rules and regulations in delivering telehealth?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">Each state and profession have their own rules and regulations. We recommend each provider familiarize themselves with the telehealth guidelines of their local licensing board/professional organization.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">I have a provisional license. Can I volunteer?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">Please discuss providing pro bono therapy with your supervisor before signing up to help.</p>
				<h3 class="faqQuestion">What if the person I matched with prefers talking on the phone?</h3>
				<p class="faqAnswer">If you are willing to provide support over the phone, it is up to you. Please remember that calls with clients are considered telehealth services. According to the American Psychological Association (2013), telepsychology includes the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies, which could be either synchronous (i.e., in real-time) or asynchronous (i.e. time-delayed, for instance, email and texting).</p>
				<h1>Whom We Serve</h1>
